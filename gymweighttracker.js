//Create an interface that will ask me to choose from a set of options--Calender, current high scores, and add a new entry.
//Maybe add another option that is quick add scores - get to choose what day to add it to (I'll need to set up a database here)
//This could work better as a website, so i can use html and css to design the website, then add a database and the interactivity using javascript
//If i create a webpage, I can have multiple tabs
//Then I can experient with adding it to a server. this will help me gain knowledge on that side of the coin too.
